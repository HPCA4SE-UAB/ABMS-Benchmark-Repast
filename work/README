(1) INTRODUCTION
-----------------
Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a class of computational models for
simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with the goal of assessing
their effects on a system as a whole. Several frameworks for generating parallel ABMS
applications have been developed taking advantage of their common characteristics,
but there is a lack of a general benchmark for comparing the performance of generated
applications. We propose and design a benchmark that takes into consideration the
most common characteristics of this type of applications and includes parameters for
influencing their relevant performance aspects. We provide an initial implementation of
the benchmark for RepastHPC one of the most popular parallel ABMS
platforms, and we use it for comparing the applications generated by these platforms.

(2) REQUIRED 
--------------------
- Open MPI 1.10.2
- TAU 2.26.3
- fftw3 library (http://www.fftw.org/) 
- Repast HPC 2.2.0  (https://repast.github.io/repast_hpc.html)

(3) USAGE (Unix/Linux)
-----------------------------
1. Model parameter selection
	-Size of communication message:
	Select the desired value of COM_BUFFER_SIZE at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-Size of FFT vector
	Select the desired value of FFT_VECTOR_SIZE at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-Size of space where agents move arround
	Select the desired HEIGHT and WIDTH at RepastHPC/include/Model.h

	-Interaction radius between agents
        Select the desired radius at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-Birth rate center, position where birth_rate aplies totaly, from this point it goes down lineally until borders of space
	Select the desired center_birth_x and center_birth_y at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-Death rate center, position where Death_rate aplies totaly, from this point it goes down lineally until borders of space
        Select the desired center_death_x and center_death_y at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-birth_rate: birth probability, inteval [0,1], 0: no birth, 1: 100% probability of birth
	Select the desired value at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h

	-death_rate: death probability, inteval [0,1], 0: no death, 1: 100% probability of death
        Select the desired value at RepastHPC/include/Agent.h
	
	-Number of agents, processors and end time before compilation
	Modify RepastHPC/props/model.props. Use work/props_samples/ as a reference  
	
	-Number of agents, processors and end time after compilation
	Modify work/props/model.props. Use work/props_samples/ as a reference

2. Model compilation

	-(Adapt following lines to your environment)
	module load gcc/7.2.0
	module load openmpi/1.10.2
	export PATH=/home/caos/amoreno/sfw/tau-2.26.3/x86_64/bin/:$PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/caos/amoreno/sfw/repast_hpc-2.2.0/lib/:/home/caos/amoreno/sfw/Boost/Boost_1.61/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export TAU_MAKEFILE=/home/caos/amoreno/sfw/tau-2.26.3/x86_64/lib/Makefile.tau-mpi-pdt 
	export TAU_COMM_MATRIX=1

	-Adapt env file to your environment

	make RepastHPC_Model 


3. Model execution

	-Some scripts samples are provided in slurm_script_samples directory for SLURM 
	sbatch ModelFLAME_slurm_de1000a10000pas2000.sh 

4. Getting results

	-An script to extrate performance results from TAU output file is provided.
	./Get_results
